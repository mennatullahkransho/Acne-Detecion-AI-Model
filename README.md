# Acne-Detecion-AI-Model-
This project is a graduation thesis that applies deep learning techniques to automatically detect acne lesions in facial images. The model is built using Faster R-CNN with a ResNet50 backbone, trained on annotated dermatology datasets. It aims to support dermatologists and skincare applications by providing an AI-assisted tool for acne analysis.
